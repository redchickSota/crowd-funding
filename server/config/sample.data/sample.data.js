The money raised here will go directly toward our floating gardens. For every $50 donation, we can add another foot of habitat. Our goal is $10,000, but every dollar exceeding this goal will only extend the gardens, becoming part of our larger vision of eventually rehabilitating an entire one-mile stretch of river, which we hope to turn into an urban wildlife sanctuary. That means more space for fish, plants, birds, turtles, and more

Urban Rivers is a Chicago-based nonprofit and this our pilot project. Our plan is to rehabilitate urban rivers in cities across the globe. By recovering habitat space in city waterways, we can provide a home for fish and other animals, while creating a nature destination for people to enjoy.`,

We believe that the ability to think critically is one of the greatest freedoms a human being can attain. We also believe that people who are confronted with art should be freer to think about themselves. And only someone who is free is able to transform their society.

With AtWork we:

- stimulate critical thinking and debate among students and young creative talents of the African continent
- equip them with the tools to question the society around them and to drive change
- connect them and create a space where they can grow and flourish

            description: `Aerostatic Bloomage is an art and urban design project for the city of Glasgow. The project is for 75 aerostats forming a dynamic floral sky-scape over Glasgow during the events of the Commonwealth Games 2014. The promise of funding for the project has not been fulfilled. Nonetheless, we feel that the critical acclaim received to date for the aspirational nature of this project suggests there may be popular interest in making some aspect of it happen. Hence, we are looking to fund at least one aerostat to launch during the Commonwealth Games attached to a community project.

Aerostatic Bloomage was conceived as an art project for Glasgow. However, we would consider producing aerostatic sculptures for other cities, events and places.`,

            description: `Thank you for helping us meet our $500,000 goal, now the mission continues! As you know, Neil Armstrong’s spacesuit will be temporarily displayed in time for the 50th anniversary of the Moon landing in 2019, but in the long-term, it will be a centerpiece of a brand new exhibition, Destination Moon, at the Museum in Washington, DC. Planned to open in 2020, Destination Moon will show those who remember the 1960s, as well as generations born afterward, how an extraordinary combination of motivations, resources, and technologies made it possible for people to walk on the Moon. The new gallery will explore how Armstrong’s “one small step…” in July 1969, in the context of the bitter, global Cold War taking place at the time, became not only a triumph for the United States, but an accomplishment that resonated around the world.

We have shared many of the artifacts planned for display in Destination Moon on our project page below. For our next goal, we are headed from $500,000 to $700,000 to tell the story of the first American in space, Alan Shepard. We plan to conserve, digitize, and display the Mercury suit Shepard wore during the first American manned space flight in 1961. Along with Armstrong’s suit, Shepard’s -- and many other suits planned for display in the new gallery – will show the progression of spacesuit technology during the space race era.

Let’s keep this incredible momentum going! Next stop: $700,000! `,
